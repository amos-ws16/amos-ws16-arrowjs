Arrow.js supports the user to identify the correlation between multiple contexts and a single file. We score the relation between different resources. As the result the user gets a score, which describes the probability of a connection between these data sets. This service is accessible through a REST call (read our [user guide](docs/user-guide.md) for more information).
